## Contribute
Contributions to our firmware are very welcome. Please contact us first via our [community forum](https://community.brewpi.com/) to discuss what you want to code to make sure that it aligns with our road map.

Please send pull requests against the develop branch. We can only accept your pull request if you have signed our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](http://www.brewpi.com/cla/).

## Development Tools 
We recommend Visual Studio Code for development.
Microsoft Intellisense doesn't work well for this codebase, so we recommend ccls instead.
Follow the install instructions here:

For automatic formatting, we use clang-format. Install it on your system and install the clang-format plugin in vscode.
